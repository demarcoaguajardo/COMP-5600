So I did all my code on Visual Studio Code before moving it to Google Colab
but I had a tough time trying to figure out how to import all my files
into one notebook, and the best way was by putting files.upload() into
my main file. I believe you have to download my four .py files and the 
three test cases to be able to successfully run my code. I'm not sure
of another way to have gotten it to work. But it's worked for me while
my python files are on my computer.

Inside the zip, you will have the 4 python files:

searchAlgorithms.py
graph.py
utils.py
main.py

as well as the 3 test case files, the notebook, and my report (pdf).

I am so sorry for the confusion but I'm not entirely familiar with
Google Colab so I really hope this works.
